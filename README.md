# Project Idea

With experience in working at larger organizations where specific skills and talent often was spread over countries and regions we realized that best practices was often hard to streamline. Leading projects ended up in contacting many colleagues to find that valuable input you needed to move forward (or being invited in too many Teams groups). Instead we thought that talent would be easier to reach by creating communities where it were requested. But instead of creating an internal platform we saw the possibility to make this available for everyone. No matter the size, seniority or type of project.

Create a user and posts to find talents and connections within specific areas/categories in tech or search for other users' posts. Move your professional or hobby project forward.

- Start page with general info and navbar
- Sign in/Sign up (create user)
- Feed with posts. Create posts, save posts, filter and sort them in the feed
- Userprofile (edit info, image, delete user etc). Find your saved posts as well as the ones you created yourself
- Visit other users' profiles (read their bio, details and look what posts they created)
- Contact page with details about each project member
- About page (detailed background and vision)
- Inspiration page with tech content
